                            My initial impression never changed throughout the entire process, they did everything they said they were going to do when they said they were going to do it. The final cost was exactly what they said it was going to be, it was done faster than we expected, and we couldn’t be happier with our new playroom.

                            I let Tequa do my work and thought I would get the same old stuff: change orders, and added costs through out the job, but I didn’t, and because of this I have a better regard for contractors now. They did the work on time, for the original amount of money and they even did more work that I asked them to do, for no added cost. I will use them again and will let everyone I know to call them for any construction projects they have. Thanks guys!

                            Tequa did a major remodel throughout my home, with very little disruption to my wife and I. The work was substantial and there were no hidden costs when the job was completed. They did it in a shorter amount of time than they anticipated, and within the original budget. They will get referrals from us. Great job, thank you.
