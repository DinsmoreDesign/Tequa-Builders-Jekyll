                    do when they said they were going to do it. The final cost was exactly what they said it was going to be, it was done faster than
                    we expected, and we couldn’t be happier with our new playroom.</i>

                    job, but I didn’t, and because of this I have a better regard for contractors now. They did the work on time, for the original
                    amount of money and they even did more work that I asked them to do, for no added cost. I will use them again and will let
                    everyone I know to call them for any construction projects they have. Thanks guys!</i>

                    Tequa did a major remodel throughout my home, with very little disruption to my wife and I. The work was substantial and there
                    were no hidden costs when the job was completed. They did it in a shorter amount of time than they anticipated, and within the
                    original budget. They will get referrals from us. Great job, thank you.</i>
