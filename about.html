                            The Tequa team did a very good job of putting my home back together after we had a flood in the upstairs bathroom. They did all that they said and quite a bit more for no extra cost. The cost of the job was much less than I thought it would be. I will recommend them to all my friends.

                            My initial impression never changed throughout the entire process, they did everything they said they were going to do when they said they were going to do it. The final cost was exactly what they said it was going to be, it was done faster than we expected, and we couldn’t be happier with our new playroom.
